# Activity Stream :: AS Event Messages

##Introduction to AS Events
The activity stream is based on events that are sent from various business or operations systems every time something of operational or business relevance happens. 
These events are sent as event-messages directly to the AS REST API or via a messaging queue. 
Each remote-event is represented by one or more event-messages. 
The event-message is the basic structure for reporting these events and they rely on semi-structured format that demands certain compliance but also leaves plenty of room for custom information.
